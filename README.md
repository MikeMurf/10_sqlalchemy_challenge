## Hawaii Climate-Analysis
The SQLAlchemy assignment required an analysis of Hawaii climate data from a local SQL database. 
The database comprised two tables that included precipitation and temperature data from nine weather stations. 
The assignment required the use of the following components to conduct the analysis: 
    Jupyter Notebook 
    SQLAlchemy 
    Pandas 
    Python 
    Matplotlib 
    Flask 
 
Jupyter Notebook, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Python, and Matplotlib were used to conduct the climate analysis and data exploration. Flask was then used to develop an API based on the results of the climate analysis.

    “climate_starter_mm” – the jupyter notebook for the Climate Analysis, 
    analysis_bonus_1_mm” - the jupyter notebook for the Analysis Bonus I, 
    “analysis_bonus_2_mm” - the jupyter notebook for the Analysis Bonus II, 
    “flask_climate_starter_mm” – the Flask Analysis App.
